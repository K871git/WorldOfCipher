* What is ths MCP servers : 
An MCP server (in the Model Context Protocol sense) is a standalone process/service that exposes a set of capabilities or 
“tools” (APIs/actions/data) to an LLM-enabled host via a standard RPC/schema. 
The MCP server advertises what it can do,
 accepts structured requests coming from an MCP client embedded in the host app, 
 executes the requested action (e.g., query a DB, read files, call GitHub), 
 then returns structured results — all via the MCP protocol (which uses JSON-RPC 2.0). 
Think of an MCP server as a smart adapter between an LLM and a real system.
