ðŸ”„ How They Connect (The Stack Picture)

Think of it like this:
Frontend (React / Angular) â†’ Handles UI and talks to backend via API calls.
Backend (Node.js + Express) â†’ Handles logic, routes, business rules. Acts like Laravel.
Database (MySQL/PostgreSQL/MongoDB/etc.) â†’ Stores persistent data.


Flow Example:

User clicks button in React â†’ API call to Express backend â†’ 
Express queries PostgreSQL â†’ returns JSON â†’ React updates UI instantly.


ðŸ”§ How You Can Use Them (as a Laravel Dev)

If you love Laravel:

Keep using Laravel backend. Pair it with React/Angular for frontend.
If you want to go full JS:
Replace Laravel with Express.js (Node).
Use React or Angular for frontend.
Choose SQL (Postgres/MySQL) or NoSQL (MongoDB) depending on data type.

Example combos:

MERN Stack = MongoDB + Express + React + Node.
MEAN Stack = MongoDB + Express + Angular + Node.
Postgres + Express + React + Node (PERN Stack).

âœ… In short:
Node.js = Runtime like PHP.
Express.js = Minimal framework like Laravel-lite.
React = UI library like Blade but dynamic.
Angular = Full front-end framework, Laravel-like philosophy.
MongoDB = NoSQL JSON storage.
Postgres/MySQL/MariaDB = Relational DBs, with Postgres = more advanced, MySQL = standard, MariaDB = community alternative.
